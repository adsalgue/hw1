## Download

1. Use the _fork link_ from the class website to create your private clone of the starter code.

2. Do `git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse230-wi19/hw1-XXX` where `XXX` is your private repo.

3. Link your clone to the "upstream" to get any updates

```
$ make upstream
```

after this you can get "updates" (in case we modify the starter code), with

```
$ make update
```

4. Edit the files and run LH 

```
$ make 
```

till it says "SAFE"

4. Save (and submit) your work with:

```
$ git commit -a -m MESSAGE
$ git push
```
